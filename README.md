# lispyc

A compiler from a lisp-like language to Python, written in Python. _lispy_ is a compiled, statically typed, lexically scoped, and type-inferred LISP-like language. Rather than being based on the more modern and complex dialects of LISP, _lispy_ is based on LISP 1.5. However, it has significant adjustments and deviations from LISP 1.5. This helps the language stay small and manageable, but a lot of the differences also stem from the need to make the language statically typed rather than dynamically typed.


## Features

* Higher-order functions
