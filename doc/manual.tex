\section{Introduction}
\lispy/ is a compiled, statically typed, lexically scoped, and type-inferred LISP-like language. Rather than being based on the more modern and complex dialects of LISP, \lispy/ is based on LISP 1.5, as described in \href{https://www.lispmachine.net/books/LISP_1.5_Programmers_Manual.pdf}{\textit{LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual}} (McCarthy et al., 1985) and \href{http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/Weismann_LISP1.5_Primer_1967.pdf}{\textit{LISP 1.5 Primer}} (Weismann, 1967). However, it has significant adjustments and deviations from LISP 1.5. This helps the language stay small and manageable, but a lot of the differences also stem from the need to make the language statically typed rather than dynamically typed.

\section{S-expressions}
The fundamental syntactic element of the language is the \textit{S-expression}. An S-expression is a branching binary tree structure of an indefinite length. In its simplest form, an S-expression is defined as either an atom or an expression \texttt{(A . B)} where \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are S-expressions. However, \lispy/ does not support the dot notation for S-expressions; it only supports the list notation e.g. \texttt{(A B)}. This is not equivalent to the previous expression. In the list notation, there is an implicit \texttt{nil} as the last element i.e.\ it is equivalent to \texttt{(A . (B . nil))}. This has a significant implication in that it's impossible to represent data like \texttt{(A . B)}. In the context of a binary tree, this restriction means that the right leaves are always \texttt{nil}. \texttt{nil} will be discussed in more detail later.

An \textit{atom}, also knows as an \textit{atomic symbol} can be either numeric, Boolean, or neither. The latter is known as a \textit{literal atom}, and in some contexts is referred to as a \textit{variable}.

There are some syntactic differences from LISP 1.5. First, commas are not valid delimiters for elements in the list notation. Second, atomic symbols can be a mix of upper/lower-case letters, digits, and underscores. These are case-sensitive. Finally, the names of constants and functions built into the language are all in lowercase.

\section{Forms}
\input{manual/forms}

\section{Top-level Program}
The top level may have zero or more S-expressions with any amount of whitespace between them. However, consecutive atoms must be separated by at least one whitespace character.

As an example, given the LISP 1.5 program \texttt{MAX (1 2)}, the equivalent in \lispy/ is \texttt{(max 1 2)}. For those familiar with LISP 1.5, \lispy/ effectively uses \texttt{EVAL} at the top level rather than \texttt{EVALQUOTE}, which makes it more akin to the modern LISP dialects.

\section{Types}
\input{manual/types}

\section{Conditional Expressions}
A \textit{conditional expression} is a special form that can branch evaluation conditionally on the value of forms. \lispy/ has two special forms for conditional expressions: \texttt{cond} and \texttt{select}.

\subsection{cond}

\texttt{cond} has one or more pairs of a predicate $p_i$ and a form $e_i$ followed by a single form $e$ at the end. A \textit{predicate} is a form that evaluates to a \texttt{bool}. All forms $e_1 \ldots e_n$ and $e$ must evaluate to the same type.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \begin{cminted}[autogobble=true, escapeinside=??]{lisp}
        (cond (?$p_1$? ?$e_1$?) (?$p_2$? ?$e_2$?) ?$\ldots$? (?$p_n$? ?$e_n$?) ?$e$?)
    \end{cminted}
    \captionsetup[figure]{font=small}
    \captionof{figure}{The \texttt{cond} special form.}
\end{figure}

From left to right, the predicate of each pair is evaluated. If $p_i$ evaluates to \texttt{true}, then $e_i$ is evaluated and returned from \texttt{cond}; no further evaluation is performed. Otherwise, $e_i$ is not evaluated and the evaluation step is repeated using $p_{i + 1}$ until $p_n$. If all predicates are \texttt{false}, the form $e$ is evaluated and returned, making it a default value for the conditional expression.

% TODO: maybe add a concrete example of using cond?

\subsection{select}

\texttt{select} has a form $p$ followed by one or more pairs of forms $(p_i\ e_i)$ and ends with a form $e$. All forms $p$ and $p_1 \ldots p_n$ must evaluate to the same type. Furthermore, all forms $e_1 \ldots e_n$ and $e$ must evaluate to the same type.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \begin{cminted}[autogobble=true, escapeinside=??]{lisp}
        (select ?$p$? (?$p_1$? ?$e_1$?) (?$p_2$? ?$e_2$?) ?$\ldots$? (?$p_n$? ?$e_n$?) ?$e$?)
    \end{cminted}
    \captionsetup[figure]{font=small}
    \captionof{figure}{The \texttt{select} special form.}
\end{figure}

First, $p$ is evaluated once and its value is temporarily stored. From left to right, $p_i$ is evaluated and compared to the value of $p$ using the built-in predicate \texttt{equal}. If this comparison evaluates to \texttt{true}, then $e_i$ is evaluated and returned from \texttt{select}; no further evaluation is performed. Otherwise, $e_i$ is not evaluated and the evaluation step is repeated used $p_{i + 1}$ until $p_n$. If no equality is found, then $e$ is evaluated and returned, making it a default value for the conditional expression.

Due to the use of \texttt{equal}, $p$ must not be a \texttt{func} or a \texttt{list} which contains a \texttt{func} at the top level or in any nested list.

\section{Evaluating Multiple Forms}
The body of a lambda can be any form, including composed forms. This means the lambda can evaluate multiple forms by continuously nesting lambdas within its body. While this is very useful, it is quite tedious. The special form \texttt{progn} solves this by taking 2 or more forms as arguments, evaluating all forms, and returning the value of the last form.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \begin{cminted}[autogobble=true, escapeinside=??]{lisp}
        (progn ?$e_1$? ?$e_2$? ?$\ldots$? ?$e_n$?)
    \end{cminted}
    \captionsetup[figure]{font=small}
    \captionof{figure}{The \texttt{progn} special form.}
\end{figure}

The forms are evaluated left to right, from $e_1$ to $e_n$. The return value of \texttt{progn} is the value of $e_n$. Because only the value of $e_n$ is used, each form may evaluate to a different type.
% TODO: show how progn translates to chained lambdas.
